# Handwritten Digit Recognition

This repository contains code for a handwritten digit recognition model using the MNIST dataset. The model is implemented in Python using TensorFlow and achieves high accuracy in classifying handwritten digits.

## Dataset

The MNIST dataset is a widely used benchmark dataset in the field of machine learning. It consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, each of size 28x28 pixels. The images represent grayscale handwritten digits from 0 to 9.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/handwritten-digit-recognition.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd handwritten-digit-recognition

3. Install the required dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

1. Run the script:
   python mnist_digit_recognition.py

2. The model will be trained on the MNIST dataset, and the training progress will be displayed in the console.

3. After training, the model's accuracy on the test set will be displayed, along with a plot showing the training history.

4. Sample predictions will be made on new data, and the predicted values along with the corresponding true values will be displayed, along with the corresponding images.

## Results

The model achieves an accuracy of approximately 98.05% on the test set. The training history plot demonstrates the model's improvement in accuracy over epochs.
